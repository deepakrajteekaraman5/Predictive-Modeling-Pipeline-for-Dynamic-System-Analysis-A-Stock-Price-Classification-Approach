# Time Series Classification Pipeline for Predictive Analysis in Dynamic Systems

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for predicting the direction of stock prices, allowing traders to classify stocks as **Buy** (if the price is expected to increase in a specified number of days) or **Sell** (if the price is expected to decrease). The pipeline leverages various classification models and utilizes a selection process to identify the top-performing models, enabling accurate and efficient time series analysis.

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven predictive modeling for analyzing dynamic systems and time series data. By refining the model parameters and visualizing classification performance through confusion matrices, this pipeline serves as a prototype for applications in both financial markets and broader dynamic system analysis.

## Features

- **Pipeline of Classifier Models**: Ten classifier models are used to evaluate and predict stock price direction, allowing for efficient selection and comparison.
- **Grid Search Cross Validation**: The top three models are tuned using Grid Search for optimized performance.
- **Performance Visualization**: Confusion matrices and classification reports provide insights into model performance.
- **Dynamic Systems Analysis**: Built with scalability in mind, this pipeline can be adapted for other dynamic systems beyond stock prices.

## Motivation

This project is inspired by the need for robust, automated methods to analyze time series data in dynamic systems. With an interest in applying machine learning to scientific discovery, particularly in stochastic and differential equation-based systems, this project serves as a foundation for further exploration in AI-driven predictive analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**: Includes pre-processing and handling of time series data for model input.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: A pipeline to streamline the selection process of multiple classification models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search cross-validation is applied to the top-performing models.
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrices are generated for visual assessment of model performance.
